## Specific QC tasks

### 1. Investigating differences in Ca between 1995 and 2019

The following links show plots of the data split by Ca level

 * Differences in the **ion balance** between 1995 and 2019 are [here](https://NIVANorge.github.io/1000_lakes_qc/pages/ion_difference_pct.html)
 
 * Differences in **measured and ion-balance-calculated conductivity** between 1995 and 2019 are [here](https://NIVANorge.github.io/1000_lakes_qc/pages/cond_difference_pct.html)
 
 * Conductivity **corrected by EH and ESO4** is [here](https://NIVANorge.github.io/1000_lakes_qc/pages/corrected_cond.html)
